        <h1>LYFESTYLE</h1>
        <p>
         Lyfestyle is a very recent album made by the well-known hip-hop artist Yeat.
         In this album, he was able to capture many hearts by recreating the feel of all 
         of his unique sounds, way back from his 2021 sound to his new, futuristic and cinematic sound
         in his second latest album 2093. He was also able to capture his high pitched sound, making
         the album extremely stylised and unique to him, therefore he has a dedicated fanbase that 
         supports what he does.
